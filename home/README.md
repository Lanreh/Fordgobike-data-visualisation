# (Ford GoBike System Data Exploration)
## by (OLADEJO OLANREWAJU OLAWALE)


## Dataset

> The data consists of information regarding 183412 bike rides, including duration in seconds, start time, end time, start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude, bike id, user type, member birth year, member gender, bike share for all trip. Preliminary Wrangling was such as conversion of datatype, extraction of start day, start month, start hour were extracted from start time column, and a column for members age was created.



## Summary of Findings

> Male users made the most bike trips and with a percentage of 74.6% of the total bike trips made but with a lower average trip duration, and the female users with 23.3% having a higher average trip duration, followed by the others with 2.1% with the highest average trip duration.
The subscribers made 90.5% of the trips while the customers made 9.5% of the total trips, also the customer users have the highest average trip duration than the subscribing user despite being less in number. The riding patterns of subscribers and customers varies, such that the subscribers use the bike system mostly on weekdays(Monday-Friday), indicating that it could be for the use of commuting to work, whereas the usage of costumers suggests that they primarily use the bike system for basic purposes as itâ€™s usage is almost very similar during weekdays and weekends.
Most of the bike rides occurred during the weekdays(Monday-Friday) indicating that the bikes were mostly likely used for commuting to their respective work station. most of the trip were started at the hour 8hr, 9hr, 17hr and 18hr which are times people leave for work (8hr and 9hr) and head back home from work (17hr and 18hr).
Majority of the riders were between the age of 20 and 40 years of age, 90.1% of the bike trips were not shared by the riders and most of the trips starting and ending at the stations with id67 and id58.
The multivariate investigation some of the trends and patterns observed in the previous bivariate and univariate investigations were further bolstered. Relationships between variables were plotted and visualized, information collected from each visualization were presented appropriately. The age group further strengthened that subscribers is age dependent especially for the older ager group, relationship between the gender and age group to determine duration for trip was also shown to be true that the younger age group take the longer trips.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on the influence of the gender, user type, and members age. 
I start by introducing the duration variable in minute, followed by the members age group distribution.
Afterwards, I used the box plots to show gender and user type average trip duration in minute.
I used the scatter plot of duration in minutes and age across gender to show the average duration of trip for each age group respective of genders, scatter plot of duration in minutes and age across user type to show the average duration of trip for each age group respective of the type of user was also used to show the influence of age groups on trip duration.
